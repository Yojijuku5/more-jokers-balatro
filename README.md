# More Jokers!
A mod for the game Balatro that inserts more Jokers into the game. Currently Work in Progress, but what I have implemented as of now DOES work.
I've taken some of the code to implement the jokers (all backend) from ShamPack (https://github.com/GoldenEpsilon/ShamPack), it's cited in the code :)
