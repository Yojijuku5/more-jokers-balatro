# More Jokers! - Full functionality not implemented yet!
A mod for the game Balatro that inserts more Jokers into the game. Currently Work in Progress (not all Jokers work yet).
I've taken some of the code to implement the jokers (all backend) from LushMod (https://github.com/lusciousdev/lushmod), it's sourced in the code :)
