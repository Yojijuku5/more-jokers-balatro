# More Jokers! - Full functionality not implemented yet!
A mod for the game Balatro that inserts more Jokers into the game. Currently Work in Progress (not all Jokers work yet).

## Dependencies
### steamodded - https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded
For opening the base game up for creating and inserting mods. Once this is downloaded, follow the instructions on the steamodded page for inserting mods.
### LushUtil (LushMod) - https://github.com/lusciousdev/lushmod
Specifically only the LushUtil.lua file is required, but you MUST have it, or the mod will not work. Since I was learning from scratch, I had a look at a few existing mods as a starting point to understand how the programming worked, and their system of implementing the Jokers into the game made the most sense to me, so I leeched onto their method. The LushUtil.lua file is not included here!
